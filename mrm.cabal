synopsis:            Modular Refiable Matching, first-class matches
description:
    This package contains an implementation of
    Modular Reifiable Matching (MRM), a new approach to two level
    types using a fixpoint of list-of-functors representation. MRM
    allows the modular definition of datatypes and functions by
    pattern matching, using a style similar to the widely popular
    Datatypes a la Carte (DTC) approach. However, unlike DTC, MRM
    uses a fixpoint of list-of-functors approach to two-level types.
    This approach has advantages that help with various aspects of
    extensibility, modularity and reuse.
